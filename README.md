# fdisk-l

This is a custom implementation of fdisk -l

#### Side note: I initially understood the task incorrectly by assuming there is only one EBR (fdisk_single.c).

Now, I am working on the general case of multiple EBRs (fdisk_all(incomplete).c) where there are some bugs in printing the linked list (Although the first EBR offset is correct).
